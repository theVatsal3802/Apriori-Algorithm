# Apriori Algorithm Implementation

In this assignment, I have implemented the Apriori Algorithm which is a fast algorithm for Association Rule mining.

## System Requirements

- Java and JVM must be installed
- Any IDE that supports Java (preferably IntelliJ Idea) should be installed.
- If no IDE is installed, the code may be run directly through the terminal

## Step to run the code

### Via IntelliJ Idea

- Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theVatsal3802/Apriori-Algorithm.git
```

- Open the cloned repo as an IntelliJ Idea project
- Open the file named `Main.Java`.
- Right click and select Run option.
- The code will automatically run.

### Via the terminal

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theVatsal3802/Apriori-Algorithm.git
```

- Open the folder in the terminal
- Run the following command to compile the code. This process will generate `Main.class` file. This file may be directly shared as it is machine independent.

```bash
javac Main.java
```

- Run the following command to run the compiled `Main.class` file.

```bash
java Main
```

- This will run the code in the terminal.

### After running the code

After the above steps are followed, the program asks for the user's input for the minimum support and the minimum confidence required in the association rules it will find from the data. Enter the required numbers and the `24CS60R26_output.txt` file will be generated.
